# Link-Shortener-System


Java Link Shortener
This is a simple command-line based URL Shortener built using Java. It takes a long URL and generates a short, unique link for easy sharing. The app also allows you to expand shortened URLs back to their original form.

The project uses HashMap for efficient mapping between long and short URLs. It includes basic error handling to prevent duplicate entries and handle invalid inputs.

✨ Features
Shortens long URLs into 6-character unique codes

Expands short URLs back to original links

Prevents duplicate short URLs for the same link

Simple CLI for user interaction

Fast performance using in-memory data structures

⚠️ Note
The generated short links are simulated and only work within the application. They do not redirect in a browser because there's no web server or hosting involved.
